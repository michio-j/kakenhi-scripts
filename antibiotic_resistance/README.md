# Resistance Gene Detection Pipeline for *Neisseria meningitidis*

This repository provides a shell script to identify antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in assembled *Neisseria meningitidis* contigs using [Abricate](https://github.com/tseemann/abricate) and [PointFinder](https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/pointfinder).

---

## üîß Requirements

- Linux or macOS environment with `bash`
- [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) for managing conda environments
- Installed tools:
  - [Abricate](https://github.com/tseemann/abricate)
  - [BLAST+](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/)
  - [PointFinder](https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/pointfinder)

---

## üì¶ Installation Example

```bash
# Create conda environment and install abricate
conda create -n abricate_env -c bioconda -y abricate
conda activate abricate_env

# Install BLAST+ if not already installed
conda install -c bioconda blast

# Clone PointFinder
git clone https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/pointfinder.git
```

## üöÄ Usage

1. Edit the script `run_resistance_analysis.sh` and replace the following variables with the actual paths on your system:

```bash
contig_data="/path/to/your/final_contig"
pointfinder="/path/to/PointFinder.py"
pfdb="/path/to/pointfinder_db"
method_path="/path/to/blastn"
```

2. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x run_resistance_analysis.sh
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
./run_resistance_analysis.sh
```

---

## üìÅ Output

- Appended result files:
  - `card_out`, `resfinder_out`, etc. for each Abricate database
  - `pointfinder_out_<sample>`: AMR gene detection results from PointFinder

> Note: All results are appended into flat text files. You may adapt the script to output one file per sample for better organization.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Ensure your input contig files are in FASTA format.
- The species name in PointFinder is set to `neisseria_gonorrhoeae`.
- All external tools must be installed and accessible in your `PATH` or specified explicitly.

## üôè Acknowledgment

This script was originally written by the repository author and was translated and refined with the help of [ChatGPT by OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com).  
Enhancements include:

- English translation of code comments
- Modular structure and generalization of file paths
- Readability and usability improvements
- Addition of logging, usage notes, and output conventions
